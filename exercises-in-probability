1. Calculate the probability of flipping a balanced coin four times and getting each pattern: HTTH, HHHH and TTHH.

  P(H) = P(T) = 0.5

  HTTH: P(H) * P(T) * P(T) * P(H) = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.625

2. If a list of people has 24 women and 21 men, then the probability of choosing a man from the list is 21/45. What is the probability of not choosing a man?
