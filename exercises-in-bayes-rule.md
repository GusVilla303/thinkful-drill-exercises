### Given:

- P(A|B) = ?
- P(B|A) = P(Positive | Infected) = .98
- P(A) = P(Infected) = .005
- P(A~) = P(Not-Infected) = .995
- P(B|A~) = P(Postive | Not-Infected) = .10
- P(B) = ?


1. Be Positive:
  ##### Answer: P(B) = P(Positive) = [P(A) \* P(B|A) \+ P(A~) \* P(B|A~)]

  ##### P(B) = .1044 = 10.44%

2. Suffer of Thripshaw's:
  ##### Answer: P(A|B) = P(Infected | Positive)

  ##### P(A|B) = .0469 = 4.69%

3. Non-Suffer of Thripshaw's:
  ##### Answer: P(A~) = .995 = 95%

4. Misclassify the person:
  ##### Answer: P(B|A~) = .10 = 10%
